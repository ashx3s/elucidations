# README

This repo is heavily influenced by [Euclid.js](https://github.com/mathigon/euclid.js) by the [Mathigon team](https://mathigon.io/). I'm interested in building off of their work but first I want to spend some time working with making a stripped down library to use for testing and experimenting with Euclidean propositions. 

The objective is more of a logic and problem solving library/app. However I want to try to stay unnecessarily true to whats written in the Elements. 

A primary task will be working from the definitions, axioms, and postulates. Then creating more functionalities will come through using the postulates/propositions to simulate and test other propositions in order to prove them and add them to the library.


## Main Tasks - Sprint 1 May 27 - June 10 2024
- [ ] **important**: Project planning
  - define scope and goals
  - outline use case(s)
  - identify MVP / core features and Stretch goals / nice to have features
- [ ] build canvas functionality
  - there needs to be an artboard of some time to draw on.
  - Use svg format first
  - ability to click and add points etc
- [ ] set up shapes and rules based on the postulates
  - allowing the ability to create stuff on a canvas so the definitions etc can be tested.
  - extrapolate creatables like shapes and actions related to them
  - extract rules and tests for validating code and equations.
- [ ] build utilities
  - small utlity functions
  - identify and create types as needed
- [ ] Brainstorm how to include the methods common to Euclidean proofs in the app.
  - these might be suggestions, validators, patterns to work with in a tutorial mode?
- [ ] Unit tests
  - set up unit tests for classes and methods
  - identify tests early on
