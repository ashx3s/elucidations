# README

This repo is heavily influenced by [Euclid.js](https://github.com/mathigon/euclid.js) by the [Mathigon team](https://mathigon.io/). I'm interested in building off of their work but first I want to spend some time working with making a stripped down library to use for testing and experimenting with Euclidean propositions.

The objective is more of a logic and problem solving library/app. However I want to try to stay unnecessarily true to whats written in the Elements.

A primary task will be working from the definitions, axioms, and postulates. Then creating more functionalities will come through using the postulates/propositions to simulate and test other propositions in order to prove them and add them to the library.

## Workflow revamp

1. Establish project foundations
   - layers and display port
   - state and storage of points and elements (rudimentary)
   - switch focus to the artboard and how the shape is held in memory etc
2. Switch back to building out the basic postulates and a few definitions
   - they can now best tested effectively
   - have a place where we can make sure our usage of definitions and axiomatic principles can used in a meaningful way
3. File editing, saving, and use of localStorage
   - fs module
   - localStorage
